    <p>
      This project is a list of companies or teams that do not rely on
      “whiteboard” interviews. The term “whiteboard” is used as a metaphor for
      interview practices that emphasize CS trivia and abstract puzzles rather
      than real-world work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whiteboards themselves are not the problem. The issue is interviews that
      focus on riddles, brainteasers, or algorithm trivia that does not resemble
      day-to-day engineering tasks. Platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode often
      fall into a similar category.
    </p>

    <p>
      The companies listed here use interview techniques that better reflect
      actual work. Common approaches include pairing on realistic problems or
      completing a paid or unpaid take-home exercise.
