A personal project I built after regularly referencing the hiring-without-whiteboards list and wanting an easier way to browse it. Full credit for the data and original work goes to the source repository.

## Data Source

Data is sourced from the [hiring-without-whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) repository.
